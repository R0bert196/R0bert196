## Hi there üëã I'm Robert!

---

I am a software engineer with a strong Java background, specializing in building secure and efficient APIs using Spring modules. I have experience with serverless and event-driven architectures, microservices, and monolithic apps.
Proficient in Docker and Kubernetes, I‚Äôve hosted apps both on-premises and in the cloud, maintained infrastructure, and managed pipelines. I enjoy programming, DevOps, networking, and security, always seeking to expand my skills and knowledge.
I am committed to continuous learning, as I believe this is the way to stay ahead it the industry.
