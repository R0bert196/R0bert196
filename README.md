## Hi there üëã I'm Robert!

---

I'm 19, currently studying at CodeCool, living in Bucharest, Romania. I love challanges, always trying to learn and experience new things. As for my personality, I would consider myself an ambivert, being able to socialise and have fun around people, but I could also find myself reading a book on a Sunday morning. I believe that networking is a vital skill which I'm constantly trying to enhance, thus, I‚Äôm looking to expand my portfolio and collaborate on something new.
